            This is my first time using Visual Studios. I absolutely Love it. It's so simple to use and I can code on it so easily becuase whatever I need just pops up and shows me if I have a spelling error, or if I put the order incorrectly. It is the best coding developing software that I have ever used. In order to use this, all I have to do is open the app, create a new folder and name it. Next I do the code and tada!! It works. It's just that simple!

            console.log("Sai Mohan");
            var FN="Sai";
            console.log(FN);
            var SN="Mohan";
            console.log(SN);
            var LN= FN.length;
            console.log(LN);
            var FN=FN.concat(SN);
            console.log(FN);
            var Awesome="I am Sai Mohan";
            var TOOO=Awesome.replace(" Sai Mohan","the cool guy who loves coding!");
            console.log(TOOO);
            var Min_Number=Math.min(1969,2009,2019,2008,1972,1879,100903);
            console.log(Min_Number);
            var Max_Number=Math.max(1969,2009,2019,2008,1972,1879,100903);
            console.log(Max_Number);
            var SQ=Math.sqrt(100);
            console.log(SQ);
